## Introduction
I built a scalable and efficient inventory management platform designed to help businesses streamline stock tracking,
automate inventory updates, and optimize operations. The platform leverages Next.js for a dynamic and responsive frontend,
styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Material UI Data Grid for seamless data handling and visualization.

On the backend, Node.js powers the application, with Prisma ORM ensuring smooth and efficient database interactions. 
Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query handle state management and data fetching, providing a fast and responsive user experience.

The platform is cloud-native, utilizing AWS services for reliability and scalability. Key integrations include:

Amazon RDS for robust database management

EC2 for scalable computing power/ main server

API Gateway for secure and efficient API management

AWS Amplify for seamless frontend deployment

S3 for secure storage solutions

This inventory management system is designed for businesses seeking a powerful, user-friendly,
and automated solution to manage their stock and operations efficiently. 
By leveraging modern web technologies and AWS infrastructure, the platform ensures scalability, security, and seamless performance.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
